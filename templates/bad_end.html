                    As the days pass it soon becomes apparent that you are now a high risk candidate for the virus.

                    You cut off all patient contact, send a explanatory email out from your phone and proceed to isolate yourself.

                    The following two days of prayer seem too little, too late as you start to exhibit the very same symptoms you used to tell others to look out for.

                     Feverish, your vision blurry, you canâ€™t help but regret your actions before. Your life, fading away, had never seemed so important to you before.

                     The faces at the glass window are sorrowful, and many. Clearly word has spread that the selfless doctor trainee has succumbed.

                     You try to console yourself with the warmth in those various gazes, but in your last moments you cannot help but question whether it was worth it.

                     With one last feeble wave at the window (or is it just a weary twitch of a finger, you can no longer tell), you slip into a disturbing yet comfortable darkness.

                     Nigirite General holds a short but nice little memorial for you, but the subsequent days bring only more chaos and death. Morale plummets, and order slowly erodes.
