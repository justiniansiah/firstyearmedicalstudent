23. I looked at the tablet Dr. Hanson had given to me. There was a list of patients I was tasked with checking on.
    Next
24. “John Doe, bed 1, admitted 8 March, 1423hrs. Severe diarrhea and vomiting. Follow up required.”
    Next
25. The details of the first patient in the ward were displayed on the screen next to a picture of a plump young man. Judging from the other details provided on the screen, it probably wasn’t the first time that he had been warded in Nigirite General.
    Next
26. I walked up to the first bed in the ward and drew the curtains. A scrawny figure lay still on the bed. His cheeks were hollow, skin pale, and he seemed to have difficulty breathing. 
    Next
27. I almost thought I had the wrong person until I noticed the nameplate behind the bedrest. The illness has certainly taken a toll on John.

# Another comment
33. John’s family was surprised by the turn of events but started packing his things in preparation for his return home.
    Next -> (35)
34. With some difficulty, John tells you about the increasing numbness he feels in his face and limbs. Unsure of what to do, you assure him that those are merely side-effects from the anaesthetics prescribed to him.
    Next
35. Wishing the best for John, you move on to the next patient.
